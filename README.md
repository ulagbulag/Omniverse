# Omniverse
the repository for storing Omniverse Extensions Code.


The Omniverse Extension embodies the philosophy of Omniverse, which aims for MicroService.
Users can develop custom extensions they want using the Extension Template, which allows them to easily add desired functionalities to the Omniverse App.

At GIST NetAI, we are continuously developing and adding extensions as part of setting up the Digital Twin Visualization Center.
